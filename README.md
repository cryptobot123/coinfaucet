Quickly thrown together faucet. There are probably a lot of bugs, and I'll try to get around to them. 

## Running this
You can just use `FLASK_APP=serve.py flask run` however if you want the captcha and such to work you'll need to 1. make a captcha account and 2. use uwsgi and make a config with the env vars.


I left in the google adsense and analytics because I couldn't find a way to add that at deployment. Enjoy :)
